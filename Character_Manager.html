        <h1>Character Manager</h1>
        <p>
            This is a project that I made with WPF. it consists of c# code and
            uses json.net to store data. I created this application because I 
            couldn't find anything that wasn't either web based or had a learning
            curve to it. I wanted to make something where you could open it make
            a character and play.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can make any number of characters and each character can hold any 
            number of items. There is currently support for D&D 5e characters and
            starfinder characters. When designing the project it was important that
            it be able to support any tabletop character format if it every needed to
            be added.
        </p>
        <p>
            this project was my first time working with WPF and I learned a lot.
            The main thing I learnt was the MVVM design pattern, and I was able to
            reinforce what I knew about the SOLID principals.
