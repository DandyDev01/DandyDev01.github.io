        <h1>Character Manager</h1>
        <p>
            This is a project that I made with WPF. it consists of c# code and
            uses json.net to store data. I created this application because I 
            couldn't find anything that wasn't either web based or had a learning
            curve to it. I wanted to make something where you could open it make
            a character and play.
        </p>
        <p>You can make any number of characters and each character can hold any 
            number of items. As of right now it does not support multi classing
            or companions, but both will be added at a later date when I have the 
            time.
        </p>
        <p>
            this project was my first time working with WPF and I learned a lot.
            The main thing I learnt was the MVVM design pattern, and I was able to
            reinforce what I knew about the SOLID principals.
