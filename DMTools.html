    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        This is a project made with WPF. It functions the same as 
        <a href="Character_Manager.html"> Character Manager</a>.
        Currently the program supports the creation of combat encounters 
        which you add players, monsters and NPCs too. It some with monster 
        creation built in and keeps track of initiative and conditions. 
        This project is in early development.
    </p>
    <p>
        This was the second project I made in WPF so my main focus here was the
        design of the UI and to make effective use of my white space.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reason I created this program was because my DM was using discord
        to keep track of things. Sure there are other systems out there, but
        I wanted to create something.
    </p>

    <h3>User Interface Design Process</h3>
    <p>
        The first step I took was to define what the problem I was trying 
        to solve was - Keeping track of combat encounters in D&D 5e.
        <br>
        With that out of the way, it was time for some requirements gathering. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A way to keep track of initiative.</li>
        <li>
            Easy access to NPC and PC information relevant to combat.
            <ul>
                <li>Health.</li>
                <li>Armor Class.</li>
                <li>Conditions.</li>
                <li>Movement Speed.</li>
                <li>Attacks.</li>
                <li>General Stats.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Way to add monsters to the encounter.</li>
        <li>Way to create encounters.</li>
        <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        After gathering the requirements I made a mockup for the for the user
        interface in Visual Studio with XAML. TO BE CONTINUED.
    </p>

    <h3>Software Design Process</h3>
    <p>
        Because I was creating the system with Windows Presentation Foundation 
        (WPF), I already knew it would be using the Model, View, View Model 
        (MVVM) design pattern. The biggest thing I needed to figure out was
        how to handle having players, monster stat blocks, and Nonplayer 
        characters. I chose to use a combination of inheritance and composition,
        this let me get the best of both worlds. Composition removed large
        inheritance trees and a one to two layers of inheritance removed
        lots of duplicate code.
    </p>

    <h3>Putting it All Together</h3>
    <p>
        Now that I had a mocked UI and knew what the systems architecture would
        look like I was able to put together an early Alpha version of the 
        program. 
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <p>
        The next steps for the program are to design and test a final version
        of the user interface. This is now the center piece of the program
        as having an easy to use interface key.
