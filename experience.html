        I did a freelance project right out of highschool to update the website
        for a local company. I create the website using the MEAN development 
        stack, Mongo DB, Expressjs, Angular, and Node.js. The site need some
        public pages that where about the company, but they also need some
        private pages for internal use.

    <p>
        During my university career I have worked with c++ to create 2 small
        console applications in groups of 4. One was a small text adventure 
        game, on this Project applided my knowledge of design patterns. Some 
        of the patterns used include the following.
    </p>
    <ul class="empty">
        <li>Observer</li>
        <li>Command</li>
        <li>Singleton</li>
        <li>Builder</li>
        <li>Mediator</li>
        <li>State</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To create the game I also needed to make extensive use of OOP concepts 
        such as inheritence, encapsulation, abstraction, etc. To make this game
        we had to use g/test, style check, and memcheck while working with git.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second application was a card game. Here our goal was to apply the
        MVC architectural pattern. This project was split into sevral phases as
        we needed to apply the agile development process. We also built upon our
        skills and tool set related to testing. for this project we needed to use
        stubs and mocking to write our tests. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Most recently I completed a course on Artificial Intelligence, for
        this class we were tasked with three programming assignments and
        a final project. The assignments and project were as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Write a program in Python to implement 8-puzzle problem using 
            iterative deepening depth-first search
        </li>
        <li>
            Implement the tic-tac-toe game using the minimax algorithm with 
            Alpha-beta pruning 
        </li>
        <li>
            Using the CSPs and backtracking search algorithm, implement a
            Sudoku solver
        </li>
        <li>
            And finally the project was to choose something for yourself to do.
            I chose to determine if it would be worth writing your own A* 
            pathfinding algorithm for games in Unity or better to use a
            package from the Unity asset store. This required me to write my
            own implementation of the A* algorithm and research ways to 
            optimize it.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1 class="Title">Personal</h1>
    <p>
        During my free time I do like to write my own software, and have worked
        with the Unity game engine for about 5 years now and by extent C#. I 
        have also worked with WPF to make two Windows applications. These personal 
        projects are where I have gotten the bulk of my experience. It was while 
        making game in Unity that I learned of many different design patterns while
        I learned about architectural patterens working with WPF.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also took it upon myself to learn Android Studio, for this I took a
        course on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> and later started
        work on a mobile application for Dungeions & Dragons character management.
