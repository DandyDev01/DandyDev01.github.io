    <p>
        Software developer by training, designer in practice.

        Kelsey is a New Media Practitioner with a background in 
        computer science. His education consists of a BFA/BSc in 
        New Media and Computer Science (Fall 2024). Currently 
        Kelsey works as a Web Accessibility Assistant for the 
        institution he attends, writing image descriptions 
        for a calculus textbook. Kelsey was introduced to 
        programming and game design back in 2016, through the 
        Unity game engine. Since then, Kelseyâ€™s programming 
        skills have continued to grow and his design focus have 
        shifted to interaction design, with the goal of creating 
        a more accessible digital world. Kelsey is working towards 
        this goal by follow accessibility practices and 
        implementing accessibility features into the interactive 
        systems he creates. Outside of work and academics Kelsey 
        continues to enjoy making small games, bike rides, and 
        playing Volleyball.

    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
    <p>
        My journey began in 2016 when I learned about Unity from an 
        online ad for a course on Udemy by GameDev.tv. I had always 
        wanted to make games and learn to program; my discovery 
        afforded me the opportunity to do both. I started out 
        designing small games, but this quickly morphed into doing
         interaction design for games and other interactive systems. 
         My focus shifted from making games that were fun to play 
         to being making games that felt good to play while still 
         being fun. At this time, I also started making of types 
         of software outside of games like a character manager 
         for tabletop RPGs. The focus of my work is to make 
         interactive systems that are simple to use and as 
         accessible as I can manage with the technologies I 
         have available to me. I believe in giving users 
         multiple ways to complete tasks as this will not only 
         help with accessibility but also supports a range of 
         different types of users. Having more than one way to 
         complete a task means novice users can have an 
         easy-to-follow method, but power users can also be 
         accommodated with short-cuts and other features that 
         are quicker than the step by step process a new user 
         would follow. For me creating simple to use interactive 
         systems means breaking things down to the bare minimum and 
         discarding anything that is not relevant to the current 
         context of the system state. This lessons the cognitive 
         load on the end user, making things easier for new users.
